# Data-Collection-System-For-Census
In this Repository, Data Collection System For Census can be found, a system developed by a team of 2nd Year College IT Students in fulfillment to their Object Oriented Programming(OOP) Subject Performance Innovative Task(PIT). 
Data Collection System For Census, an offline software application designed to help census workers in collecting data for census surveys . It integrates various functions such as adding a respondent and their details, updating their recods, data validation for data integrity, capable of exporting records into documents for reports and further. 

Key Components of DCSC:
Hardware: Can be used with just a laptop or a PC. 
Software: The DCSC application itself, which provides functionalities like searching the records for the respondent's information, managing respondent details, and data validation.
Data: Encompasses Personal details about a respondent, name, address, date of birth, housing information, etc.
Procedures: Worker or Admin account creation, managing respondent information, and managing worker accounts(for admin only) .
People: Admins, Census Workers and IT staff who use and support the system.

How the DCSC Functions as a System:
When a worker adds details or information about a respondent, the DCSC software, automatically saves it in a database and is ready to be managed. The worker can then either update an existing record, delete it, or validate it. The worker can also Forward those data about the respondent to the admin. 
The Admin, works as the central database where all gathered data about  the respondent handled by the worker, data that is validated by the worker is stored. Admin can also manage their workers under them. 
This helps lessen the burden for Census Worker in carrying printed forms where the respondent has fill in their personal information, this system helps both the worker and the respondent save time, and work productively.
